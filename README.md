## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement  
Taxi fare prediction is critical for both riders and drivers to ensure transparency and efficiency. This project tackles the challenge of predicting fares accurately using spatial, temporal, and contextual features like pickup/dropoff coordinates, timestamps, and passenger counts. The goal is to build a robust regression model that generalizes well to unseen data while handling real-world complexities like outliers and geospatial noise.

## âœ¨ Key Features  
- **Optimized Data Handling**: Efficiently load and sample 55M+ rows.  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Haversine distance calculation for trip routes.  
- **Feature Engineering**: Temporal features (hour/day/month) and outlier detection.  
- **Model Comparison**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
- **Interactive Notebooks**: ReviewNB integration for collaborative Jupyter notebook reviews.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
**Source**: [Kaggle NYC Taxi Fare Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction)  
- **Training Data**: 55M+ rows (1% sampled for efficiency).  
- **Test Data**: 9,914 rows.  
- **Features**: `fare_amount`, `pickup/dropoff` coordinates, `pickup_datetime`, `passenger_count`.  

**Preprocessing**:  
- Removed invalid coordinates (lat: 40â€“42, lon: -75â€“-72).  
- Filtered negative fares and unrealistic passenger counts.

## ðŸ”„ Workflow  
1. **Data Acquisition**: Download from Kaggle using `opendatasets`.  
2. **EDA**: Analyze distributions, visualize geospatial clusters, and detect outliers.  
3. **Preprocessing**: Clean data and engineer features (Haversine distance, time-based features).  
4. **Model Training**: Train and compare Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
5. **Evaluation**: Validate models using RMSE.  
6. **Submission**: Generate Kaggle-compatible predictions.
